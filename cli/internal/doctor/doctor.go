// Package doctor is the facade for `codefall doctor`, the command that reports whether a project has
// what it needs to run codefall end to end. It reports and never repairs; `codefall init` will own
// the fixes.
//
// Exported identifiers here are the component's whole public API. Its layers live under this
// package's own internal/, where the compiler keeps them (ADR-BASE-02).
