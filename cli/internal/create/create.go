// Package create is the facade for `codefall create`, the command that starts a project from nothing:
// it makes the directory, the git repository and its remote, and a first commit holding a README.md
// and a .gitignore, then runs `codefall init` there and offers to push.
//
// Exported identifiers here are the component's whole public API. Its layers live under this
// package's own internal/, where the compiler keeps them (ADR-BASE-02).
