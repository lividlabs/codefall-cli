// Two sources, in this order. gh is asked first because it answers with the repository as GitHub
// knows it today, which is the right answer after a rename and for a fork whose remote still names
// the upstream. The git remote is asked second because it needs neither authentication nor network
// and git is a tool every run already requires — so a directory that has a GitHub origin gets an
// answer whether or not gh is installed and signed in.
//
// Every way of not knowing means the same thing to the caller — there is nothing to suggest — so a
// missing tool, a directory that is not a GitHub repository, and a tool failing for its own reasons
// all return None rather than an error (ADR-GO-03).
