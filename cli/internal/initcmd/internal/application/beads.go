// visible in the file, so a teammate who finds .beads/interactions.jsonl appearing in a pull request
// can see it was turned on deliberately and where. bd config set is asked rather than the file
// edited because bd knows where the database is (BEADS_DIR relocates it) and codefall does not.

// in that clone, and bd points it at the root's .beads/hooks even when it wrote the database
