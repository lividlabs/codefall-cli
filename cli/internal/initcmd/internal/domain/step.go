// Step identifies one unit of work an init run performs. The ID is stable and machine-readable; the
// Title is what a person reads while the step runs.

// The steps an init run performs, in the order it performs them. The settings file comes first, the
// harness extension second, Beads third, the hooks that tell the harness about Beads and guard the
// default branch fourth, and the sections that tell an agent how the project uses Beads, keeps its
// local environment current, and writes its test cases fifth. The hook step follows the extension
// step because the scripts the hooks run are what the extension step copies. The agents step follows
// Beads because bd init commits what it staged, and codefall's edit to AGENTS.md belongs in the
// author's own commit rather than bd's — which is the same reason the last two steps come last:
// the testing tree, .ignore, and .gitignore are the author's files to commit, not bd's.
//
// The testing step is sixth, after the agents step and before the ignore step. It belongs beside the
// agents step because the two write the same pair of documents under the same rule — an AGENTS.md
// and the CLAUDE.md that points at it — and it has to come before the ignore step, which keeps the
// testing root's run output out of the repository and cannot name a root before it is declared.
