# codefall-envision — where it came from

Why `SKILL.md` looks the way it does. None of this is instruction — the skill is the instruction.
This exists so nobody re-adds something that was removed on purpose.

## Length is proportional to input

The job is to get the user's words onto paper in an order that reads well, not to fill in what they
did not say. A heading with invented content under it is worse than no heading, because a later
reader cannot tell which parts came from the user. Unknowns are correct output for the same reason:
pretending to have resolved something is a defect, and a vision with four open questions has done
its job.

## The off-ramp is about size, not concreteness

Every tell in the off-ramp table is about the size of the thing, or about the *why* already
existing. None is about how concretely the user can describe the *what*. Someone can name every
screen, state exactly what a user will see, and hand over finished mockups, and still have written
nothing down about the problem any of it solves — and that person needs a vision more than most,
because the reasoning exists only in their head.

## The floor is advice, not a gate

One bug, one screen, one endpoint, one field is usually smaller than a vision is worth. But the
user knows things about the work that the skill does not, and a vision nobody needed costs a file.
So the skill says what it thinks and writes the vision if that is what they want.

## Siblings, not a parent

Each problem that stands on its own is its own vision, and what connects siblings is the source
they came from: each one's `Related` line points at the same saved document or mockup directory.
The `specs` field on `Related` is a list for the same reason — one vision can produce several
specifications, and the vision is what groups them, which is why `codefall-specify` writes sibling
specs rather than a parent.

## `Active` belongs to `codefall-implement`

`Active` records the observable fact that work has started, at the first claim that traces back to
the vision. That is the one transition another verb makes, and the carve-out the repo's rules allow
for recording a fact. A vision still at `Ready` means `codefall-implement` has not run against it.
Two optional header fields, `Revised by` and `Replaced by`, exist because a vision can be under
active work and partly revised at the same time, and a single status line cannot say both.

## `docs/visions/AGENTS.md` stands in for an ignore file

The file says that `archive/` is history and is not read unless asked. That is the closest thing to
an ignore file that works across harnesses: Claude Code has no `.agentignore`.

## Mockups go to `docs/mockups/`

That is where `codefall-design` and `codefall-implement` look for them, and a surface outlives the
vision that prompted it. The import procedure is shared with `codefall-specify` and
`codefall-mock-up` so the three never drift.

## The source is always saved

The source records what the user actually brought; the vision records what was made of it, and
someone may need to check one against the other. Reformatting a coherent document into the
template's headings destroys work and adds nothing, which is why a strict superset is adopted
unchanged.

## Ask once for material, then drop it

Someone who has a pitch document will say so. Chasing material the user did not mention wastes the
part of the process that produces original thinking, and questions asked mid-dump interrupt the only
part that produces original material.
