# codefall skills — operative rules

Terse on purpose: the why lives in the ADRs and the linked docs. This file holds the rules for
writing and changing a skill; the extension-wide rules, ADR immutability, prose, and workflow, are in
[`../AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md).

## Shape

- Named as **verbs** (`codefall-scaffold`, `codefall-graft`), one directory each:
  `<verb>/SKILL.md`.
- Every skill carries `disable-model-invocation: true`, except `codefall-refresh`, which carries no
  such line. Running a verb is a deliberate act; refresh is the one exception because it writes
  nothing but a git-ignored stamp, and `implement`, `design`, and `specify` run it when preflight
  reports the environment stale. No other skill invokes another through the harness.
- A skill reports and offers; it applies only what the user takes. Nothing lands unrequested.
  Recording an observable fact is the exception: a skill that owns a status transition sets it when
  the fact occurs and reports that it did — `codefall-implement` flipping a concept to `Active` at first
  claim is this shape. Judgment transitions — promote, archive, revise — stay offer-only.
- **Refuse only what you cannot do.** A missing surface profile, a missing tool, an unsupported
  tracker — those are exits. Disagreeing about size, altitude, or fit is not: say what you think and
  why, then do what the user asks. `codefall-conceptualize`'s floor and `codefall-specify`'s cohesion check are both
  this shape.
- Never present an option that would be refused — unsupported stacks and planned profiles are
  exits, not menu choices. See the stack question in `codefall-scaffold`'s SKILL.md.
- Every verb reads `.codefall/skills/<verb>/CUSTOMIZE.md` from the user's project when it exists —
  project procedure the extension cannot know. The procedure lives in
  `extensions/shared/customizations.md`; a skill points at it and never restates it.

## Length

Guidelines, not hard limits — [ADR-004](../../docs/adrs/ADR-004-skill-length-guidelines.md) has the
reasons and the sources.

- A `SKILL.md` body stays **under 500 lines** and **under 5,000 tokens**. Past 5,000 tokens the tail
  of the skill is dropped after a compaction, and the tail is where Process and Rules sit.
- Tokens are estimated: characters ÷ 4 and words × 1.33, the larger one read as the number.
- The `description` stays under 1,024 characters.
- `../scripts/skill-health.sh` reports every skill against these and the supporting-file rules
  below. CI runs it; `--strict` makes it fail.

## What goes where

- `SKILL.md` holds **instruction**: what to do, in what order, with what gate. The level of detail
  follows the operation — exact steps where the operation is fragile, the goal alone where several
  approaches are valid. The how stays; the why does not.
- **Reasons and rejected alternatives** go to an ADR when the repo decided it, or to the relevant
  `AGENTS.md` when it is a convention. A skill states a rule; it does not argue for it.
- **Lineage** — what a skill took from other tools and what it dropped on purpose — goes to
  `<verb>/NOTES.md`, following `codefall-review`. Never loaded by the skill.
- **Material read on demand** — lifecycle tables, strategy detail, lens definitions — goes to a
  supporting file that `SKILL.md` links directly, with one sentence saying what it holds and when
  to read it.

## Supporting files

- Linked **directly from `SKILL.md`**, one level deep. A supporting file does not link on to a file
  `SKILL.md` does not also link.
- Over **100 lines**: open with a table of contents.
- Directories are named for what they hold: `templates/` for what a skill installs, `trackers/` for
  tracker profiles, `scripts/` for what a skill runs, `reference/` for what a skill reads on demand.
  Add a directory when the content is a kind these do not describe.
- Extension paths inside a skill are relative to the skill's own directory —
  `../codefall-scaffold/templates/…` — never `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`.
  Harnesses that mirror the tree under `.agents/skills/` do not define that variable, and the
  relative form resolves under them and under Claude Code alike. Hooks are the exception, and the
  rules for them live in `../hooks/`.
- **A shared file is named `../../../.codefall/shared/<file>`**, from a `SKILL.md`, and one `../`
  deeper from a supporting file. `codefall init` installs `shared/` once, into the project's
  `.codefall/`, whatever harnesses it was run for (ADR-006), and that path reaches it identically
  from `.claude/skills/<verb>/` and `.agents/skills/<verb>/`. In this repository the same file is at
  `extensions/shared/`, which is where `../scripts/skill-health.sh` resolves the `.codefall/` prefix.

## Templates and ownership

- **Whose document is it** decides who repairs it. A file the extension ships that nobody amends — the
  operative rules a verb installs alongside a directory it owns, like `docs/concepts/AGENTS.md` — is
  repaired by the verb that owns it, on run. A template that becomes the project's own document, one
  that gets stamped, amended, and cited, belongs to `codefall-graft`, and ships a row in its scope table and in
  `lineage.md`. Do not route a fixture through `codefall-graft`: it buys consent machinery for a decision with
  no stakes, and costs a registration step whose failure is silent. Either way, **never overwrite a
  file that has drifted** — show the difference and ask.
- Renaming, moving, or retiring a template ships a row in
  `codefall-graft/lineage.md`, in the same PR. `codefall-graft` can only tell a rename from
  a deletion plus an addition because that record exists.

## Prose

- Declarative, refusals stated plainly, reasons linked rather than attached. Read
  `codefall-scaffold`'s SKILL.md end to end before writing one.
- The banned words in [`../AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) apply.
