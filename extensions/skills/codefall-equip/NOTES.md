# codefall-equip — where it came from

Why `SKILL.md` looks the way it does: what was taken from elsewhere, what was rejected, and what was
tried and dropped. None of this is instruction — the skill is the instruction. This exists so nobody
re-adds something that was removed on purpose. The reasoning behind the contract itself is
ADR-005 in the repository's `docs/adrs/`, and the reasoning behind the testing track is ADR-007.

## Taken

**A per-project sync skill from an earlier toolkit** — the observation that pulling `main` has
consequences the pull does not perform, and that a teammate who does not read diffs needs a single
thing to run. That skill knew one project's package manager, migration tool, and containers. What
this skill keeps is the job; what it drops is knowing the project, which moved into scripts the
project owns.

**`codefall-scaffold`'s stack question** — name what the evidence already implies and confirm it,
rather than asking a question the repository could have answered. Here that is "search first, then
ask with evidence".

**`codefall-graft`'s report-then-take** — a candidate is shown with what is wrong with it before
anything is declared, and the user takes it or not.

**`codefall-implement`'s definition of done** — a change that makes the scripts stale changes the
scripts in the same pull request, the same way tests and docs are part of done rather than a
follow-up.

**demo-flights' `dev-test-backfill`, step 1** — a testing cycle does not grow its own tooling. There,
a state no existing harness can produce is recorded as an unforceable criterion rather than
answered by building something new mid-run. Codefall takes the same position and makes it
structural: the harness is built by this verb, in its own pull request, and no run that is about
cases changes what runs them.

## Rejected

**Doing the environment work in the skill.** Re-deriving what to run from the repository on every
invocation varies between runs, spends a model turn on what a lockfile already says, and cannot be
run by a person, by CI, or by a harness without the extension.

**Generating the scripts at run time.** Every cost of the above, plus a file that changes under the
project with no diff anyone reviewed.

**A one-time onboarding verb.** First draft and revision are the same procedure — read the
repository, read the scripts if they exist, propose, confirm, write, declare — so a verb named for
running once would have run every time a tool was introduced. This skill is named for what it does
to the repository rather than for when.

**`codefall-refresh` drafting on its first run.** A verb that runs daily and also does one-time
inference is two verbs. It also put the drafting interview in front of the one person least placed
to answer it: a teammate running refresh because the section in `AGENTS.md` said to.

**A template per stack.** A signals table covers more ground with less to maintain: a project is a
set of signals, not a stack, and a Go API with a Prisma-managed database is two rows, not a profile
nobody wrote.

**Routing the script through `codefall-graft`.** Graft moves documents against templates the
extension ships, with provenance. The scripts have no template behind them once drafted — they are
the project's — and this skill is already the verb that revises them, so graft would be a second
owner.

## Why the rules are shaped this way

**Never destructive.** A script that resets to reach a known state is not idempotent; it is
starting over. "Bring the project up to date?" has to be a question a teammate can always answer
yes to, and that holds only when the answer never costs them data.

**Proving is offered, not done.** `start` brings real services up on the user's machine. That is
the one thing in this skill that reaches outside the repository, so it is a yes-or-no.

**Two calls of `update` are the proof.** The second call exiting `0` quickly is the contract made
observable: cheap when nothing changed, and safe to run again.

**Two tracks chosen by the argument, rather than one run that does both.** The testing procedure
went in as a second Process section, picked by `local` or `test`, and not as steps 7 onward of the
existing one. The two share the search-first shape and nothing else: different evidence, a different
question, a different block written, a different proof, and in the user's project a different pull
request. A single run would put two confirmation gates and two real-service proofs in one turn, and
would leave a user who came to revise `update` after adding a migration waiting through a runner
interview. The argument also gives `codefall-scaffold` and `codefall-implement` a way to name the
track they follow, which is the local one in both cases.

**The harness is its own pull request.** ADR-005's point-of-introduction rule makes a task's pull
request carry the script change the task caused, and stops there. Setting a runner up is not caused
by a task: it adds a dependency, a configuration file, an `update` step, and a settings key, none of
which the task's reviewer asked to read. `codefall-implement` names this skill and leaves the beads
that need a case unstarted instead.

**Names in settings, commands in the testing root's `AGENTS.md`.** The split is by reader. Programs
read the runner names — the check scripts decide which runner-specific rules apply, doctor decides
whether the project is equipped — and only a person or an agent runs a command, which is also the
only part that varies with the project's own idiom.

**An empty tree is what proves a harness.** The runner's list command against no cases shows the
configuration collects from the declared root, and that is the whole claim this verb makes. Writing
a case to prove the runner would put authoring in the wrong verb and leave a test behind that nobody
designed.
