description: Equip a project with the two things it has to have before the other verbs work. The local environment — start, which brings the services the project develops against up, and update, which makes the local environment match the checkout — declared under local in .codefall/settings.json and run by codefall-refresh. The test harness — a spec runner per surface, its configuration pointed at the testing root, its name declared in test.runners and its commands recorded in the testing root's AGENTS.md — which codefall-test runs cases through. Either way it finds what the project already has, or drafts it from what the repository shows, confirms, writes, and declares. Builds and rebuilds; codefall-scaffold and codefall-implement follow the local-scripts procedure.

# Equip

Equip a repository with what the other verbs need it to have. Two things: the **local environment**
— a `start` command that brings its services up and an `update` command that makes the local
environment match the checkout — and the **test harness** — the spec runner that collects the specs
beside the project's test cases. Both are the project's own, and both are declared in
`.codefall/settings.json`: the scripts under `local`, which `codefall-refresh` runs from then on,
and the runner's name under `test.runners`, which `codefall-test` reads before it runs a case.

Equipping is neither refreshing nor testing. This skill finds, drafts, or revises what a project
runs with and declares it; it runs it only to prove it. Bringing an environment current on an
ordinary day is `codefall-refresh`; running a suite or a case is `codefall-test`.

Paths that start with `reference/`, `templates/`, or `../` are relative to this skill's directory,
not the user's project. A path through `../../../.codefall/` is the one that leaves the skills
directory: it names a file `codefall init` installed in the project's own `.codefall/`.

## The two tracks

One run equips one of the two. Each has its own search, its own question, its own declaration, and
its own proof, and in the user's project each lands as its own pull request.

| Argument | Track | Procedure |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `local`, or a path alone | the two local-environment scripts | [Process — the local scripts](#process--the-local-scripts) |
| `test` | the test harness | [Process — the test harness](#process--the-test-harness) |

A path may follow either word; it is the project directory, and the working directory is the
default. With no word at all, read `.codefall/settings.json`, say what `local` and `test` declare
today, and ask which of the two to equip before anything else.

## Files beside this one

Read each when its step says to; none is loaded up front.

- `reference/signals.md` — what in a repository says which tools it uses, the entry points a
  project may already have, and what each maps to in `start` and `update`. Read at step 2 of the
  local track.
- `templates/local.sh` — the default shape of the script when the project has no task runner of
  its own: one file, two subcommands. Read at step 3 of the local track.
- `reference/testing.md` — the whole testing procedure: what to search for, the runner each surface
  takes, what installing each one means, the exact shape of every write, and how the result is
  proven. Read at step 1 of the testing track.

## Scope — what a project runs with, not the running

| In scope | Out of scope | Whose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Finding the scripts and the runner a project already has | Running the scripts on an ordinary day, and pulling or comparing the checkout | `codefall-refresh` |
| Drafting the scripts when there are none | Running a suite or a case | `codefall-test` |
| Installing or declaring a spec runner per surface | Writing a test case | `codefall-implement` |
| Revising either when the project's tools change | Deciding which tools the project uses | `codefall-design` |
| Declaring `local` and `test.runners` in `.codefall/settings.json` | Per-branch databases, shared or otherwise | the project |
| Recording the runner's commands in the testing root's `AGENTS.md` | The testing root, its tree, and the `CODEFALL TESTING` section | `codefall init` |
| Proving a candidate meets the contract | Any other settings field | `codefall init` |

**Every run does the same thing**, whether what it equips exists or not: read the project, read what
is there, propose the draft or the revision, confirm, write, declare. There is no first-time mode.

## The contract

What the declared `start` and `update` promise. A candidate that does not keep it is reported and
never declared; a draft that would not keep it is not written.

- Both are **shell commands run from the project root**, declared as strings. A Makefile target, a
  package script, or a script of the project's own are all fine.
- **`start`** brings up what the project needs running locally to develop against. Exit `0` when
  everything it manages is up, whether it started it or found it running. Safe to call twice; the
  second call is cheap.
- **`update`** makes the local environment match the checkout: dependencies to the lockfile,
  pending migrations applied, generated code regenerated, whatever a changed definition
  invalidates rebuilt. Exit `0` when the environment matches. Safe to call when nothing changed,
  and cheap then — it asks the package manager and the migration tool, which already answer
  "nothing to do" quickly, rather than doing the work unconditionally.
- **`update` may assume `start` has run.** It does not start anything; `codefall-refresh` runs
  `start` first.
- **Plain scripts.** A person runs either from a terminal. CI can run either. Neither needs the
  extension or a harness. A non-zero exit and a sentence on stderr are how one reports a problem,
  written for the person who reads it next.
- **Never destructive.** No dropping a database, no deleting data directories, no `--force`
  recreation. A command that resets state to get to a known state is not idempotent; it is
  starting over every time.

## Search first, then ask with evidence

On an existing project the scripts usually exist under some name already. Read the repository
before asking anything, name what was found, and ask one question:

> I found `make dev-up`, which starts Postgres and Redis through compose, and `npm run db:migrate`.
> Are these the start and update commands, or should I draft new ones?

A user who knows corrects it. A user who does not know takes what was found. A repository with
nothing gets the draft offer. A repository whose scripts were written for a different caller — a
first-clone setup that prompts, a sync that pulls — gets the draft offer too, with the steps the
draft keeps from those scripts named. **Never ask whether something exists before looking**: the
repository answers that faster than the person, and the person may not know.

The testing track works the same way. A project that already runs end-to-end tests has a runner
configuration and a directory holding them, and both are found and named before the question is
asked.

## When another verb follows this skill

`codefall-scaffold` and `codefall-implement` read this file as the procedure; nothing invokes it
through the harness. Both follow the local track only: **a test harness is never set up inside
another verb's pull request.** When a task needs a case and no runner is declared,
`codefall-implement` says so, names this skill, and leaves those beads unstarted.

- **`codefall-scaffold`, at runnable-skeleton depth.** Nothing exists to search for; skip step 2.
  Draft from what scaffold emitted — its manifest, its compose file if any, its migration tool —
  declare, and prove the scripts as part of scaffold's own verification. At docs-only depth write
  nothing and name this skill in scaffold's report as owed work.
- **`codefall-implement`, on a task that introduces infrastructure, a dependency, a migration, or
  generated code.** The bead's acceptance criteria name the script change; the bead is the
  confirmation. Read the declared scripts, revise them per step 3 for what the task introduced,
  keep the contract, and change the declaration only when an entry point moved. The change lands
  in the task's own pull request and is named in its body.

## Project customizations

Follow `../../../.codefall/shared/customizations.md` for this verb.

## Process — the local scripts

### 1. Read the project

The target is the path argument, or the working directory. Read `.codefall/settings.json` and note
whether a `local` block is declared; read the declared scripts when it is. Read the project's
`AGENTS.md`, root and scoped, for verify commands and conventions. If there is no
`.codefall/settings.json` at all, stop and say `codefall init` comes first.

### 2. Find what is already there

Read `reference/signals.md`. Two searches:

- **Entry points** the project already has — Makefile and justfile targets, package scripts, a
  `scripts/` directory, a Taskfile or mise tasks, a `bin/setup` — whose names or bodies say start,
  up, setup, bootstrap, migrate, sync, dev.
- **Signals** of the tools the environment needs — lockfiles, a compose file, a migrations
  directory, a codegen config, a dotenv sample file — which decide what a draft has to do and what
  a candidate has to cover.

Check each candidate against [the contract](#the-contract) by reading it, not by running it, and
say which of two things a candidate that does not keep it is. A candidate that resets, drops, or
deletes is **wrong** for any caller; say which line and why. A candidate that prompts, or that
pulls before it migrates, is **written for a different caller** — a first-clone setup, a sync
someone runs by hand — and is correct for that caller; say so in those words, and say what
`codefall-refresh` needs instead: "`scripts/sync.sh` is right for what it does. Refresh runs
`update` with nobody at the keyboard and with the checkout its own, so it needs the same steps
without the git ones." Never tell the user their scripts are broken when they are not.

Then ask the one question, with what was found beside it. Three answers:

- **Declare what exists.** Go to step 4 with the candidates as they are.
- **Draft new.** Go to step 3 with the signals.
- **Revise what is declared.** The block already exists and the user says the tools changed. Go to
  step 3 with the declared scripts open.

When no candidate keeps the contract, the first answer is not offered. Ask draft or revise only —
revise only when a `local` block is declared — and name the steps of the existing scripts the
draft reuses verbatim, so the user sees what they keep: "the draft takes your sync script's
compose, install, and `prisma migrate deploy` steps, minus the git steps and the dirty-tree guard."

### 3. Draft or revise

Read `templates/local.sh`. The shape follows the project:

- A project with a **task runner idiom** — a Makefile, a justfile, package scripts everyone runs —
  gets two targets in that idiom, so the commands read like the project's others.
- A project with **none** gets `scripts/local.sh` from the template, with `start` and `update` as
  its subcommands and the declaration pointing at each.

Each step in `update` is the tool's own idempotent form: `npm ci` not `npm install`, `migrate
deploy` not `migrate reset`, `go mod download`, `uv sync`. A step whose tool has no cheap no-op —
`npm ci` reinstalls every run — is guarded the way the template shows. The project's sample env
file is copied to the file its tooling loads only when that file is missing, never overwritten,
and before any step that reads it. `start` uses the compose file's own wait (`up -d --wait`) where
it has one. Every step carries a one-line comment saying what it brings current.

A **revision** changes only what the introduced tool needs and leaves the rest of the script as
the project wrote it. Show the diff, not the whole file.

Show the full draft, or the diff, and confirm before writing anything.

### 4. Declare

Write the `local` block into `.codefall/settings.json`, keeping every other key and the file's
formatting:

```json
"local": {
  "start": "scripts/local.sh start",
  "update": "scripts/local.sh update"
}
```

Commands are relative to the project root. A script of the project's own is made executable.

### 5. Prove them

Offer to run them; running `start` brings real services up on the user's machine, so it is a
yes-or-no rather than a step. On yes: `start`, then `update`, then `update` again. The second
`update` must exit `0` quickly, and that is the proof of the contract. A failure is fixed in the
script and the proof re-run; a failure that is the environment's — Docker not running — is
reported as such with what to do.

Then run `codefall doctor` when the CLI is on `PATH` and read its **Local environment** section:
both checks pass, or the declaration is wrong and step 4 is repeated. A warning about the refresh
stamp not being git-ignored is `codefall init`'s to fix; name it in the report.

### 6. Report

- What was declared, and whether it was found, drafted, or revised.
- Whether the scripts were proven, and by which run.
- What the user still owes the project: commit the scripts and the settings; run
  `/codefall-refresh` once so the stamp exists; `codefall init` if doctor warned about
  `.gitignore`.

## Process — the test harness

`reference/testing.md` carries this track in full — what to search for, the runner each surface
takes, what installing one means, and the shape of every write. Read it at step 1 and follow it.
`<root>` is the testing root `test.dir` declares.

### 1. Read the declaration

The target is the path argument, or the working directory. Read the `test` block in
`.codefall/settings.json`. No block, or no `.codefall/settings.json` at all: stop and say
`codefall init` declares the testing root first — this skill never declares one. Then read
`reference/testing.md`, the project's root `AGENTS.md`, and `<root>/AGENTS.md`.

### 2. Find what is already there

Search for a runner configuration and for the directories the project keeps end-to-end tests in,
and read each hit rather than counting it. Name the surfaces the repository shows.

### 3. Ask the one question

One question, with the evidence beside it: declare what exists, or set up the default runner for
each surface. A surface this version has no spec runner for — React Native, Tauri, Flutter — is
refused for the `spec` modality here, with the reason, and the refusal is said before it is asked
about. Agentic cases stay available for it wherever `codefall-test` has a driver.

### 4. Set the runner up

Install or declare it per `reference/testing.md`: the dependency, and a configuration whose test
directory is `<root>/test-cases` and whose match is the runner's suffix, with retries off and one
worker. Show the configuration and confirm before writing anything.

### 5. Declare and record

Write `test.runners` into `.codefall/settings.json`, keeping every other key and the file's
formatting. Write the runner's line into the Runners section of `<root>/AGENTS.md`: its name, the
command that runs every spec, and the command that runs one case. Names go to settings because
programs read them; commands go to `<root>/AGENTS.md` because agents and people run them.

### 6. Revise `update`

The runner's own install is part of making the environment match the checkout — Playwright's
browsers, a Go tool the specs build with. Revise the declared `update` by step 3 of the local
track, keeping [the contract](#the-contract), and say what changed.

### 7. Prove it

Run the runner's list command against the empty tree: Playwright exits `0` and lists no specs,
which shows the configuration collects from where it says, and `go test` answers
`matched no packages`, which is that runner's expected answer until a spec exists. Then run
`../../../.codefall/shared/check-cases.sh`, and `../../../.codefall/shared/check-cases-playwright.sh`
as well when the runner is Playwright; no cases yet is a pass. Then `codefall doctor`, whose
**Testing** checks must all pass.

### 8. Report

What was declared and whether it was found or installed; where the runner's line went; what
`update` gained; what the proof showed. What the user still owes: commit the configuration, the
settings, and `<root>/AGENTS.md` as their own pull request, then write the first case through
`/codefall-implement`.

## Rules

- **Search before asking.** Name what was found; never open with "do scripts exist?"
- **The contract is not negotiable.** A candidate that drops, resets, or deletes is reported and
  never declared, however convenient it is.
- **Nothing is written without confirmation.** The full draft or the diff, shown first.
- **Every run is the same procedure**, first draft and revision alike. No one-time mode.
- **Revise the smallest thing.** A revision touches what the introduced tool needs and leaves the
  project's own lines alone.
- **Declare relative to the project root.** Commands, not paths; a task runner's target is a
  command.
- **Proving runs real services, so it is offered.** Never started on the user's machine unasked.
- **Only the `local` block and the `test` block's `runners`.** No other settings field is this
  skill's to touch — the testing root, the tree under it, and the `CODEFALL TESTING` section are
  `codefall init`'s.
- **The runner follows the surface.** Playwright for a browser front end, an Electron shell, or an
  HTTP API; `go test` for a Go surface.
- **Refuse the `spec` modality where this version has no runner** — React Native, Tauri,
  Flutter — and say which modality remains.
- **Names in settings, commands in `<root>/AGENTS.md`.** Never the other way around, and never both.
- **A harness is equipped in its own pull request.** It never rides along in a task's.
- **Cases are not this skill's.** An empty tree is what proves a harness; writing the first case is
  `/codefall-implement`.
- **Refresh and test are not this skill.** Say so and stop when the user wants the environment
  brought current, or a suite run, rather than equipped.
