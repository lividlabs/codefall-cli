# Specify

Turn a feature idea into a specification precise enough that another session can implement it
without re-interviewing anyone.

The output is a **spec document in the repository** at `docs/specs/SPEC-NNN-slug.md`, holding one or
more requirements, each with a user story and numbered acceptance criteria. The issue tracker gets a
generated mirror. **The document is canonical**; the issues are regenerated from it.

Specifying is not designing. Once the criteria are written and confirmed, stop. How the thing gets
built is `codefall-design`'s work.

Paths that start with `../` or `trackers/` are relative to this skill's directory, not the user's
project. A path through `../../../.codefall/` is the one that leaves the skills directory: it names
a file `codefall init` installed in the project's own `.codefall/`.

## Files beside this one

Read each when its step says to; none is loaded up front.

- `reference/specification.md` — the user story, the six EARS patterns with a worked example,
  observability, prohibited vocabulary, numbering, and the optional sections. Read before step 7.
- `templates/specs/SPEC.md` — the document template. Read at step 10. Every bracketed instruction
  in it is stripped on emit.
- `templates/specs/AGENTS.md` — the operative rules this skill installs at `docs/specs/AGENTS.md`.
- `trackers/github/PROFILE.md` — the GitHub tracker profile: issue shape, labels, creating,
  refreshing, archiving. Read at step 12, and at step 3 for the duplicate search.
- `../../../.codefall/shared/import-mockup.md` — the shared procedure for bringing a user's mockup into the
  repository. Read at step 8 when they have one.

## Scope — what, not how

Specify decides **what will be true when this is done**, never **how it gets built**.

| In scope | Out of scope |
| --- | --- |
| Who the consumer is and what they get out of it | Which layer, component, or module the work lands in |
| What they can observe when it works | File paths, libraries, services, frameworks |
| Domain nouns and what they mean | Their fields, types, relations, or storage |
| What must keep working that already works | API shapes, message contracts, schema |
| What is explicitly not included | Work breakdown, ticket sequencing, dependency edges |
| Which questions remain unresolved | Estimates, effort sizing, build order |

The tell is a specification that names a technology. If the criteria mention a table, a class, an
endpoint, or a package, they are describing the solution.

**You may read the codebase, but only to answer two questions**: does this already exist, and what
would this change silently break? Reading code to decide *how* to build the thing is
`codefall-design`'s job, even when the answer seems obvious.

## What a specification is

One **spec document** per feature. Inside it, one or more **requirements**, each with a user story —
`As a <consumer>, I want <capability>, so that <benefit>`, the "so that" mandatory — and its own
acceptance criteria in EARS. A requirement is the unit that becomes a ticket.

Identifiers nest and are written in full: `SPEC-003`, `SPEC-003-REQ-01`, `SPEC-003-REQ-01-AC-01`.
Three digits for the spec, two for the rest, zero-padded, append-only at every level. Criterion
numbers restart under each requirement.

The rules for stories, criteria, and the optional sections — Edge cases, Key entities, Assumptions
— are in `reference/specification.md`.

## Status and lifecycle

Three states, one word plus a date.

| Status | Meaning | Lives in |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Draft — <date>` | Being written. The user stopped and is coming back | `docs/specs/` |
| `Ready — <date>` | Written and agreed. The normal end of a session | `docs/specs/` |
| `Archived — <date>` | Superseded or dropped | `docs/specs/archive/` |

- **Status describes the document, never the work.** Work state is the tracker's.
- **`Ready` is the normal end of a session.** Set `Draft` only when the user said they are stopping
  and will come back.
- **A spec is never renumbered and its identifier is never reused.** Archiving moves the file to
  `docs/specs/archive/` under the same name; citations still resolve.
- `Archived` gains a `**Replaced by:** SPEC-NNN — <date>` line when something took its place.
- Transitions are this skill's to make. Report the state and offer; never transition a spec on your
  own initiative.

## The specs directory

`codefall-specify` maintains `docs/specs/AGENTS.md` from `templates/specs/AGENTS.md`: written when
the directory is created, added on a later run if it is missing.

**Never overwrite a file that has drifted.** When one exists and differs from the template, show the
difference and ask. Replace it only on a yes; on a no, leave it and say nothing further about it.

## Mockups are keyed by surface, not by spec

Mockups live at `docs/mockups/<slug>/`, where the slug names the surface — `booking-history`,
`trip-share`. They are **never** filed under a spec or a concept. Specs reference them by path under
**Design notes**. Do not move existing mockups into a spec directory, and do not create one.

## Cohesion and splitting

**A spec holds one cohesive feature.** Its requirements share a consumer and a purpose. Requirements
that share nothing but the session they were written in are two specs.

- **Push back once when a spec looks incohesive**, with a specific alternative — not "this is
  large" but "requirements one through three are about exporting and four and five are about
  sharing permissions; those look like two specs to me."
- **Then defer.** If the user disagrees, write what they asked for.
- **Split results are siblings, not a parent and children.** `SPEC-003`, `SPEC-004`, and `SPEC-005`
  sit alongside each other; the concept above them is what groups them. Do not invent a parent spec.
- When a sibling deserves its own interview, say so and suggest a separate `codefall-specify`
  session rather than writing a thin document now.
- Record the concern in the spec **only** when the user did not engage with it, phrased as an
  observation for `codefall-design` to weigh. If they considered it and disagreed, nothing goes in.

## Tracker profiles

The specification is tracker-neutral. Where the mirror lands, and in what shape, is a **tracker
profile** — one directory per tracker, as `codefall-scaffold` handles surfaces.

| Tracker profile | Covers | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `github` | GitHub Issues, optionally with a GitHub Project | **supported** |
| `jira` | Jira Cloud and Data Center | planned |
| `linear` | Linear | planned |

- A tracker is **supported** only when `trackers/<name>/PROFILE.md` is complete. A planned profile
  is an exit, not a menu choice — if the user's tracker is Jira, say plainly that `codefall-specify`
  does not mirror to it yet and stop.
- GitHub is the only supported profile, so there is no question to ask: state that the mirror will
  land in GitHub Issues and confirm the repository.
- Read the profile's capability table before writing, and follow its fallbacks rather than
  improvising around a missing feature.
- **The spec is written even when the mirror fails.** The document is the deliverable. Give the user
  the exact command to fix the tracker and say the mirror is pending. Do not discard the spec.

## Project customizations

Follow `../../../.codefall/shared/customizations.md` for this verb.

## Process

### 1. Check preconditions

Run the shared check against the user's project. It reports what is set up and repairs nothing.

```bash
"../../../.codefall/shared/preflight.sh" .
```

`beads=ok` advances to step 2. Otherwise read `beads_reason`, tell the user what is missing, hand
over the command that fixes it, and **stop**:

| `beads_reason` | What is wrong | Give them |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `not_installed` | `bd` is not on PATH | `brew install beads` |
| `not_initialized` | this repository has no beads database | `bd init` |
| `unreadable` | bd found a database and could not read it | quote `beads_detail` |

Then read the checkout lines. `behind` above `0` or `refresh=stale` means the environment may not
match `main`: say so and run `/codefall-refresh` before continuing. `refresh=undeclared` names
`/codefall-equip` instead. Never pull the checkout or run the local commands from here.

**Never run the remedy.** `bd init` writes `.beads/`, git hooks, `.claude/settings.json`, and a
block in `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`, then commits all of it. That is the user's decision.

### 2. Ask what they want to build

One open question:

> "What would you like to build? A sentence or two is enough to start."

**Then look for a concept.** If `docs/concepts/` exists, read the live concepts there — not
`archive/` — and offer the relevant one as context:

> CONCEPT-002 covers the auditing rework and looks like the frame for this. Want me to work from it?

A concept is **never required**. It carries the *why* and improves the Context section. It does not
carry acceptance criteria: its **Proposed shape** is a rough direction, and step 5 still interviews
for everything. Do not lift criteria out of a concept and do not treat its **Open questions** as
settled.

Do not change the concept's `Status`. Work starting is `codefall-implement`'s transition to record.

### 3. Check whether it already exists

Three searches before spending the user's time on an interview:

- **The specs** — read `docs/specs/`, not `archive/`.
- **The codebase** — Glob and Grep for what they described: filenames, exported identifiers, route
  segments, domain nouns.
- **The tracker** — the profile supplies the search command.

### 4. Report what you found

- **A spec already covers it.** Link it. Ask whether it is the same thing, and whether they want to
  revise that one rather than write another.
- **It exists in code.** Describe what is there, with file paths. Ask whether that is what they
  meant, and if not, what the distinction is.
- **An issue already covers it.** Link it. Ask whether it is the same thing.
- **Nothing found.** Say so and move on.

If the user confirms existing work covers their need, **stop the skill**.

### 5. Interview

**Style.** One or two questions at a time, never a wall. Start broad and narrow. Use the user's own
vocabulary.

**Cover what is still unclear** — skip anything the description already settled:

1. Who the consumer is.
2. What they can do that they could not do before.
3. What starts it — an action, an event, a schedule.
4. What they observe when it works.
5. What happens when it does not — empty, unauthorized, upstream failure, bad input.
6. Which boundary conditions matter, and which are being left alone.
7. What this depends on that does not exist yet.
8. What is explicitly out of scope.

Question five feeds the `IF … THEN` criteria and question six feeds **Edge cases**: five asks what
the system does when something goes wrong, six asks which situations nobody intends to handle.

**Push back on vague answers.** Name the vague word and ask for a concrete replacement:

| They said | Ask |
| --- | --- |
| "fast" | Faster than what? What latency is acceptable, and at which percentile? |
| "good UX" | What does good look like here — a reference product, a specific interaction? |
| "manage" | Which actions: create, edit, delete, reorder, archive? |
| "integrate with X" | Which part of X — their search, their booking flow, their SSO? |
| "like before" | Like which screen, which flow? Walk me through it. |
| "just works" | What is the success path, and what is the failure path? |
| "real-time" | Under a second, or under a minute? |

Before advancing, judge the answers against consumer, trigger, observable outcome, and failure
behavior. **If fewer than roughly three of the applicable ones are concrete, do not advance.** Say
which ones are thin and ask.

**Insist for at most two rounds.** If the user overrules — "just write it with what we have" — write
it, and record every unresolved item under **Open questions**. Recorded, never quietly dropped.

**Raise design concerns as flags, not rulings.** Name a problem once and let them decide:

> "One thing I want to flag — a destructive action behind a hover has no reachable equivalent on
> touch. How are you thinking about that?"

Cap at two rounds per concern. If it stays unresolved, it goes under **Open questions**.

**"Like $COMPANY does it."** When the user references another product, offer once to look it up. On
yes, research it and summarize only the patterns that matter — never dump page content. Confirm the
distillation with the user before it reaches the document. On no, move on without searching.

### 6. Audit what already exists

A specification describes what the user wants **added**. **Silent omission from a specification is
not a deletion.** For each surface the feature touches — a screen, a route, a component, an entity,
a table:

1. **Read the current artifact.** Not its name, its contents. If it does not exist yet, skip.
2. **Enumerate what is there.** Tabs, fields, states, columns, branches.
3. **Intersect with what the user described.** What did they account for? What did they leave out?
4. **If there is a real gap, ask.**

   > "The profile screen has three tabs today: Account Info, Travel Preferences, and Saved Passengers.
   > You mentioned the first two. Is Saved Passengers preserved as-is, folded into something new, or
   > intentionally going away?"

   - **Preserved** — record it under **Existing behavior preserved**.
   - **Merged** — record how it composes, and cover it with a criterion.
   - **Removed** — this becomes its own acceptance criterion. **A removal is never an implicit
     consequence of the specification.**

Audit the surface the feature touches, not the whole application.

### 7. Shape the requirements

Read `reference/specification.md`. Cut what the user described into requirements. Each one is a
capability a consumer can use and a ticket someone can pick up.

**Requirements decompose by what a consumer can observe.** `codefall-design` decomposes by what can
be built, and one requirement may become several of its tickets. Do not do that cut here.

**The sizing question**: could one person hold this requirement in their head well enough to design
it in a single pass? If not, it is more than one requirement.

Then apply the [cohesion check](#cohesion-and-splitting) to the set.

### 8. Mockups

When the feature has a visual surface, ask whether a mockup exists.

- **They have one** — import it per `../../../.codefall/shared/import-mockup.md`. It lands under
  `docs/mockups/<slug>/`, and the spec references that path under **Design notes**.
- **They want one but do not have it** — the specification proceeds without it and the tracker
  issue is marked `requires-mockup`. `codefall-design` refuses to act on an issue carrying that
  label.
- **Do not draw a mockup inside this skill.**

### 9. Recap before writing

> Here is what I have. Tell me what is wrong.
>
> **Consumer**: …
> **Requirements I would write**: …
> **What starts each one**: …
> **What they observe**: …
> **Failure behavior**: …
> **Boundary conditions being left alone**: …
> **Already exists and must keep working**: …
> **Assuming without asking**: …
> **Out of scope**: …
> **Unresolved**: …
>
> Does that match what you have in mind?

**Every line is at least a sentence.** A line that collapses to a fragment or a dash means that
topic was not interviewed — go back and ask.

Advance when every line is substantive, the user has confirmed it, and you could write the criteria
without guessing at any of them.

### 10. Write, then confirm

Pick the identifier: read `docs/specs/`, take the highest existing number plus one, zero-padded to
three digits. Read `archive/` for this and this only — a retired identifier is never reused.

Compose the full document from `templates/specs/SPEC.md` and **show it to the user before anything
is written**. Omit empty sections, header rows included: a spec with no concept has no
`**Concept:**` line. Say which optional sections you left out and why — "no Key Entities section,
because the nouns here are ordinary English" — so the user can catch an omission that was a gap.

Then set the status: `Ready`, unless they said they are stopping and coming back, which is `Draft`.

### 11. Write the spec

Write `docs/specs/SPEC-NNN-slug.md`, and `docs/specs/AGENTS.md` if it was missing.

Do not commit.

### 12. Mirror to the tracker

Follow the creation sequence in `trackers/github/PROFILE.md`. The document is canonical and the
issues are generated from it, so this step never asks the user to re-approve content.

### 13. Wrap up

Report the spec path, its identifier, its status, every open question it carries, and the issues
that were created, with links.

If a concept framed this work, add the spec identifier to its `Related` line. Add the identifier and
change nothing else in the file.

## Other modes

Invoking this skill on an existing spec does one of four things. Ask which if it is not obvious.

- **Promote** `Draft` to `Ready`, or **reopen** `Ready` to `Draft`.
- **Edit** a `Draft` or `Ready` spec. Adding a requirement appends the next `REQ` number; adding a
  criterion appends the next `AC` number within its requirement. Retired numbers stay retired.
  Re-mirror to the tracker afterwards.
- **Archive** a spec: set `Status: Archived`, add `Replaced by` if something took its place, move the
  file to `docs/specs/archive/`, and close or relabel its issues per the tracker profile.
- **Split** a spec into siblings, per [cohesion and splitting](#cohesion-and-splitting).

Every one of these is a user's decision. Report the state and offer; never transition a spec on your
own initiative.

## Rules

- **Nothing is written without the user confirming the full document first.**
- **The document is canonical.** Tracker issues are generated from it and regenerated on later runs.
  Never treat a hand-edited issue body as the source of truth.
- **The specification says what, never how.** No file paths, no libraries, no services, no schema. A
  domain noun may be named and defined; its fields, types, and relations may not.
- **Acceptance criteria are EARS, and nothing else is.** Pick the pattern that fits rather than
  writing everything as `WHEN … THEN`.
- **"so that" is mandatory** in every user story.
- **Criteria are observable in a running system**, and the instrumentation to make them so is part of
  the requirement — surfaced out loud, never absorbed silently.
- **Criteria exist for coverage, not symmetry.** Requirements with different criteria counts are
  expected.
- **Numbering is append-only at every level.** Retired numbers are never reused.
- **Status describes the document, never the work.** Work state belongs to the tracker.
- **Silent omission is never a deletion.** A removal is always its own criterion.
- **Mockups are keyed by surface**, never filed under a spec.
- **Push back once, then defer.** On vagueness, on design concerns, on cohesion. The user knows the
  domain and you may be wrong.
- **Unresolved is recorded, not dropped.** Open questions go in the document.
- **Never overwrite a file that has drifted.** Show the difference and ask.
