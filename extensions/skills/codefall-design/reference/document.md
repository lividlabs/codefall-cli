The shape of `docs/designs/DESIGN-NNN-slug.md`. Read before designing (step 5) and again when
drafting (step 7).

## The header

A title heading and two rows, the same shape `VISION` and `SPEC` documents use. The body starts at
`## Overview`.

```markdown
# DESIGN-007: Stage context handoff

**Status:** Ready — 2026-08-31
**Related:** spec: SPEC-004 · adr: ADR-003
```

`Status` is always present. `Related` appears only when there is something to relate, and is a
labeled list, not a set of rows.

| Label | Holds |
| --- | --- |
| `spec` | The specification this design implements |
| `vision` | The vision that framed it — **only when there is no spec** |
| `adr` | The ADR or ADRs this design produced |

**Never record a hop you can derive.** A spec names its vision in its own `**Vision:**` row, so a
design records the spec alone. A design written from a vision with no spec records the vision. A
design with neither has no `Related` row until it produces an ADR.

## Required sections

| Section | Holds |
| --- | --- |
| **Overview** | The approach in a paragraph, plus the key decisions and why each was made |
| **Architecture** | Components, their relationships, and data flow. Mermaid where a diagram earns its place. May be a paragraph for small work |
| **Task Plan** | The task table, under a callout that says whether the beads exist yet |

**Research findings go inline**, in Overview or Architecture, next to the decision they bear on.
There is **no sibling `research.md`**, and no `data-model.md`, `quickstart.md`, or `contracts/`.

## Conditional sections

Include a section only when its trigger fires. Nothing is written to fill a heading.

| Section | Include when |
| --- | --- |
| **Components and Interfaces** | New or changed public types, APIs, or contracts |
| **Data Models** | Anything persists, or the shape of state changes |
| **Error Handling** | New failure modes, or the fix *is* a failure mode |
| **Testing Strategy** | The test approach is non-obvious. Skip it when "add a regression test" covers it |
| **Technical Context** | A new dependency, or infrastructure is touched |
| **Alternatives Considered** | A real choice was made. This is also the ADR trigger |
| **Hard Constraints** | There are invariants worth asserting directly |

## Technical Context

A fill-in-the-blank block. Drop a line whose answer is "unchanged" rather than writing the word.

```markdown
## Technical Context

- **Language / version** — Go 1.23
- **Primary dependencies** — `samber/do`, `pgx/v5`
- **Storage** — Postgres 16, existing `bookings` schema
- **Testing** — `go test`, `testcontainers` for the integration pass
- **Target platform** — Linux container, deployed as the existing API service
- **Performance goals** — p99 under 200ms for the read path
- **Constraints** — no new outbound network dependency
- **Scale** — roughly 40 writes/second at peak, unchanged by this work
```

## Hard Constraints

EARS-lite: `THE SYSTEM SHALL …`, for invariants only — concurrency, data integrity, security
boundaries. Only the ones worth testing directly. This is not `codefall-specify`'s full EARS: a
criterion is what a consumer observes; a hard constraint is an invariant of the implementation.

```markdown
## Hard Constraints

- THE SYSTEM SHALL hold no more than one open write transaction per booking at a time.
- THE SYSTEM SHALL reject a context payload whose signature does not verify, before parsing it.
```

## Task Plan

One table under a callout. The table keeps its shape for the life of the design; the callout is
**rewritten in place** when the beads are created.

```markdown
## Task Plan
> Staged. Not yet in Beads.

| ID | Task | Depends on | Design ref |
|----|------|-----------|------------|
| T1 | Add `StageContext` type + serde | — | Components |
| T2 | Wire context load into `/scaffold` | T1 | Architecture |
| T3 | Emit context on `/envision` exit | T1 | Data Models |
| T4 | Integration test: vision → scaffold | T2, T3 | Testing Strategy |
```

The local IDs make the dependency edges reviewable before the beads exist, and they name the beads
once they do. The **Design ref** column names the section of this design that motivated the task,
so `codefall-implement` opens the relevant fifteen lines rather than the whole document.

The table holds what the design decided: the tasks, their edges, and the section each came from.
Work state — status, assignee, comments — is Beads' alone, and **the table never grows a column for
it.**

## Task Plan, after creation

The callout is rewritten; the table stays.

```markdown
## Task Plan
> Created in Beads 2026-08-29 as `booking-DESIGN-007`, one bead per row as `booking-DESIGN-007-Tn`.
> This is the plan as last approved. Beads is authoritative, and a difference between the two is
> reconciled by revising the design.

| ID | Task | Depends on | Design ref |
|----|------|-----------|------------|
| T1 | Add `StageContext` type + serde | — | Components |
| T2 | Wire context load into `/scaffold` | T1 | Architecture |
| T3 | Emit context on `/envision` exit | T1 | Data Models |
| T4 | Integration test: vision → scaffold | T2, T3 | Testing Strategy |
```

Bead identifiers are the document's own numbering behind the project's prefix —
`<prefix>-DESIGN-NNN` for the epic, `<prefix>-DESIGN-NNN-Tn` for each task — set by `bd rename`
after creation, per `beads.md`. The callout names the epic in full, so a reader sees the prefix
without running `bd`, and the per-row form says what every task is called; there is no column of
bead IDs because every one is derived. A replaced task's old bead is renamed
`<prefix>-DESIGN-NNN-Tn-superseded`, and the current bead always holds the plain ID.

A row's title, edges, and design ref change only through Revise, which edits the row and the bead
together (`revising.md`), and a revision adds its date to the callout: `Created in Beads
2026-08-29, revised 2026-09-10, as …`. A bead edited directly with `bd` is the one way the table
falls behind the graph, and the rules installed at `docs/designs/AGENTS.md` forbid it. Anything
filed under the epic since creation — discovered work, the landed bead — is Beads' alone and never
a row.

A design created before the table stayed carries a mapping line in place of the table. Its epic
still resolves by number, and its first revision rebuilds the table from the beads before going row
by row.

## Local IDs are append-only

`T1`, `T2`, `T3` are permanent within a design. **A retired local ID is never reused.** A removed
row comes out of the table and its ID goes on a `Retired:` line under it, so the next task added
takes the number after the highest ever used, never the first gap — that would silently make `T2`
name a different bead.

```markdown
| T5 | Load context in every verb's preamble | T1 | Architecture |

Retired: T2
```
