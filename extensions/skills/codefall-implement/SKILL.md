# Implement

Walk the graph `codefall-design` created. Claim what is ready, build it, verify it, open a pull
request, and let each close unblock the next task until the frontier is empty.

Implementing is not merging. A run ends at open pull requests and a reported merge order — **a human
performs every merge to `main`, and this skill never does**, in any mode, under any instruction
short of the user editing this file. Merges into an epic branch are the one exception: the epic
branch exists to fan work back in, and the human gate sits at its aggregate PR.

Paths that start with `reference/` or `../` are relative to this skill's directory, not the user's
project. A path through `../../../.codefall/` is the one that leaves the skills directory: it names
a file `codefall init` installed in the project's own `.codefall/`.

## Files beside this one

Read each when its step says to; none is loaded up front.

- `reference/landing.md` — the three landing strategies, file-scope prediction and the hotspot
  rule, and the branch diagrams. Read at step 4.
- `reference/beads.md` — every `bd` command a run issues: session start, claim and close, the
  landed bead and its gates, discovered work, session end. Read at step 5.
- `reference/workers.md` — launching a worker, the worktree seeding rule, chain sequencing, the
  result JSON, and failure handling. Read at step 6.
- `reference/mirror.md` — how the spec's tracker issue walks the work's state. Read at step 6 and
  step 8.
- `worker-prompt.md` — the prompt rendered for each worker.

## Scope — build, not decide

| In scope | Out of scope | Whose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Executing tasks from the graph | What the tasks are, or their edges | `codefall-design` |
| Branches, worktrees, commits, PRs | Merging anything to `main` | the user |
| Every test the current work needs | Regression campaigns and fresh-context retesting | `test` |
| Harness checks on its own diffs | Independent review and verdicts | `review` |
| Bead lifecycle: claim, close, discovered work | Creating or re-cutting the task graph | `codefall-design` |
| The concept's `Active` transition | Any other document transition | the owning verb |
| Mirroring work state to the spec's tracker issue | The mirror's lifecycle and labels | `codefall-specify` |

**A task that turns out to be wrong is reported, not redesigned.** When the design's cut does not
survive contact with the code, say what you found and hand the graph back to `codefall-design`.

- **Implement writes every test the current work needs** — planned by the design's Testing
  Strategy or discovered mid-task, unit, integration, and end-to-end alike. A missing test is
  written, not sent back to `codefall-design`.
- **The `test` verb owns what comes after the work lands**: regression passes, coverage campaigns,
  agentic testing in a fresh context.

## One bead or the graph

The argument fixes the scope; the skill never infers it.

| Invocation | Scope |
| --- | --- |
| `/implement bd-abc` | That bead, alone |
| `/implement bd-a2g` (an epic) | The epic's whole graph, until its ready set is empty or a gate stops the run |
| `/implement DESIGN-007` | The design's epic, via the mapping line in its Task Plan |
| `/implement` | Show ready work grouped by epic and ask |

A design whose Task Plan still says `Staged. Not yet in Beads` has no graph to walk. Refuse and
point at `/design`.

**Tier 0 is not a separate mode.** A bare bug bead is single-bead scope with a shorter reading list.

**Scope and execution style are different decisions.** Picking an epic decides *what*; whether it
runs as one serialized stack or parallel workers is decided afterward from the graph's shape, at
the go gate.

## What gets read

Per bead, in order, before any plan is formed:

1. **The bead** — `bd show <id> --json`: the description, the Design ref, the acceptance criteria,
   and `spec_id`, the design document's path.
2. **The design document** — Overview and Architecture always; the specific section the Design ref
   names; Hard Constraints; Technical Context and Testing Strategy when present.
3. **The spec**, one hop up the design's `Related` line — its acceptance criteria are the
   externally observable contract. The concept only when there is no spec.
4. **ADRs** — the ones on the design's `Related` line plus the project's `docs/adrs/` baseline.
   Never rewritten; a conflict between a task and an ADR goes back to `codefall-design` as a
   superseding-ADR conversation, never a quiet exception.
5. **The project's `AGENTS.md`**, root and scoped — workflow rules, verify commands, conventions.
6. **Mockups** under `docs/mockups/` when referenced. A working mockup is still a drawing: it
   proves an interaction and gets rebuilt in the app's stack. Never copy its markup.

A tier-0 bead has no document behind it; the list collapses to bead + `AGENTS.md` + ADRs.

## Landing strategies

Three ways work reaches `main`; `reference/landing.md` has the rules and the diagrams.

| Strategy | When |
| --- | --- |
| **Parallel stacks** (default) | Independent chains with disjoint predicted file scopes |
| **Single stack** | Overlapping file scopes, uncertainty, or fan-in without a need for parallelism. Always correct |
| **Epic branch** | Fan-in across chains, or work that must not land on `main` in increments — *and* parallelism matters |

Depth never forces the epic branch. Hotspot files count as overlap until shown otherwise. When
parallel stacks cannot be shown safe, serialize.

## The go gate

One approval, before any work starts. Everything the run will do, in one block:

- the landing strategy and its one-line reason ("linear chain of 7, no fan-in → single stack");
- the branch diagram;
- the waves, and how many workers run concurrently in each — **there is no default cap**; the wave
  is sized by the graph and the file scopes, and the user trims it here if it is too wide;
- the model proposed per bead, and one session-level effort recommendation as the exact command —
  "recommend `/effort high` before go." When one bead wants far more than the rest, propose it as
  its own batch;
- what will be claimed in beads, and — when a concept sits behind the work — that go flips it to
  `Active`;
- the permissions condition: background workers cannot answer permission prompts, so the session
  must allow edits and Bash without prompting, or the run offers single-task mode instead.

**Single-bead scope shrinks the gate to a plan approval**: the files to touch, the approach, the
test plan, one branch.

**After go, waves proceed on their own.** Failures are the only mid-run stop.

Model choice is the root's, made at the gate. A bead already carrying execution metadata is taken
as a recommendation and shown in the table; **implement never writes or edits bead metadata** —
what actually ran is recorded in a `bd comment`, beside the PR link.

## Verification and done

A bead is done when three things are true: **its acceptance criteria hold, the project's checks are
green, and its PR is open.** Done is not merged.

**Where the commands come from.** Implement hardcodes no build, lint, or test invocation:

1. `.codefall/skills/implement/CUSTOMIZE.md` — verb-specific tuning, such as a fast subset per bead
   with the full suite reserved for pre-PR;
2. the project's `AGENTS.md` — scaffolded projects carry the command list in their verification
   section;
3. inference from the repo (`package.json` scripts, `Makefile`, `go.mod`) — stated at the go gate,
   with an offer to record the inferred commands in `AGENTS.md`.

The resolved list is passed into worker prompts. Workers re-derive nothing.

**The checks:**

- The project's own verification commands, run until clean.
- The harness's built-in passes on the bead's own diff, where the harness provides them:
  `simplify` always; `code-review` and `security-review` when available. These are checks inside
  implement, not review — implement renders no verdict on its own work.
- The bead's acceptance criteria, checked one by one. What passed goes into the close reason. A
  bead with no acceptance field falls back to the design's Hard Constraints plus the spec's
  criteria, and the close reason still records what was verified.

**Tests are part of done, not a follow-up.** So are the local scripts: a bead whose criteria name
the `start` and `update` change, or whose diff adds infrastructure, a dependency, a migration, or
generated code, changes the declared scripts in the same PR, following the `codefall-equip`
skill's section *When another verb follows this skill*. The bead is the confirmation; the PR body
names the change.

## Merges and the mirror

**The root never merges to `main`.** The extension ships a `PreToolUse` hook that denies it; a
denial from that hook is the system working as designed. What the root does merge: worker PRs into
the **epic branch**, one at a time, at wave boundaries.

At close-out the run reports the **merge order** — bottom-up per stack; GitHub retargets each PR as
its base merges — and stops. `bd gate check` turns the merges into bead state next session.

The spec's tracker issue walks the work's state per `reference/mirror.md`. Every PR body carries
`Relates to #<spec-issue>`.

## The concept transition

`codefall-conceptualize` reserves one transition for this skill: `Status: Active — <date>`. At the
run's first claim, resolve the concept — the design's `Related` line to the spec, the spec's
`**Concept:**` row to the concept, or the design's `concept` label when there is no spec — and flip
its Status line. Automatically, no ceremony: this records an observable fact. Report it — "CONCEPT-012
→ Active."

Once, idempotently. Already `Active`, or no concept in the lineage: nothing to do. Only the Status
line is touched, ever.

## Picking up an interrupted run

State lives in three places — beads, git, GitHub — and a resumed session reconciles them rather
than re-running anything:

| Found | Meaning | Do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bead closed, PR merged | Finished and landed | `bd gate check` records it; nothing else |
| Bead closed, PR open | Done, awaiting the human | Leave it; it is in the merge order |
| Bead claimed, branch pushed, no PR | Worker stopped before `gh pr create` | Verify the branch, open the PR from the root — do not re-run the work |
| Bead claimed, no branch | Work never started or never landed anywhere | Relaunch the worker with the same rendered prompt |
| Bead unclaimed but `bd ready` says ready | Never started | Normal flow |

A stacked chain resumes from its highest link with an open PR; everything below is merged or
awaiting merge, and everything above follows the normal sequence.

## Project customizations

Follow `../../../.codefall/shared/customizations.md` for this verb.

## Process

### 1. Check preconditions

Run the shared check against the user's project.

```bash
"../../../.codefall/shared/preflight.sh" .
```

`beads=ok` advances. Otherwise read `beads_reason`, tell the user what is missing, hand over the
command that fixes it, and stop:

| `beads_reason` | What is wrong | Give them |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `not_installed` | `bd` is not on PATH | `brew install beads` |
| `not_initialized` | this repository has no beads database | `bd init` |
| `unreadable` | bd found a database and could not read it | quote `beads_detail` |

**Never run the remedy.** `bd init` writes and commits real files; that is the user's decision.

Then read the checkout lines. `behind` above `0` or `refresh=stale` means the environment may not
match what the work will build on: say so and offer `/codefall-refresh` before continuing.
`refresh=undeclared` names `/codefall-equip` instead. Never pull the checkout or run the local
commands from here; `refresh` owns both.

Then read the project's `AGENTS.md` (root and scoped) and `.codefall/skills/implement/CUSTOMIZE.md`
— workflow constraints, verify commands, pinned board IDs, a standing strategy preference.

### 2. Fix the scope

Per [One bead or the graph](#one-bead-or-the-graph). With no argument, run the session-start
commands in `reference/beads.md` — `bd ready` unfiltered, since no epic is chosen yet — then show
the ready set grouped by epic, with title, priority, and what each unblocks, and ask. Never infer a
batch from an unprompted ready set.

### 3. Read

The full list in [What gets read](#what-gets-read), for every bead in scope. Reconcile the design
against the code as it stands on the base branch — cite file and line for anything the design
assumed that has moved — and default to preserving whatever the design is silent about.

### 4. Classify the landing strategy

Read `reference/landing.md`. Build the graph picture (`bd ready --mol <epic> --explain`,
`bd dep tree`), find the chains and any fan-in, derive each chain's predicted file scope from its
Design refs, apply the hotspot rule. Pick, constrained by `AGENTS.md` and `CUSTOMIZE.md`.

### 5. The go gate

Present the block per [The go gate](#the-go-gate) and wait. On go, per `reference/beads.md`: flip
the concept to `Active` if one is behind the work. Epic scope: create the epic branch if the
strategy calls for one (`epic/<id>-<slug>` off `main`, pushed), create the landed bead, claim the
epic and the first wave, `bd dolt push`. Single-bead scope: claim the bead, `bd dolt push`, nothing
else.

When the user overrules the classifier the same way twice, offer to record the preference in
`CUSTOMIZE.md` — offer, never write unasked.

### 6. Execute the waves

Per `reference/workers.md`. Per wave: render worker prompts, launch the batch, wait for results.
Verify each success — branch on the remote, PR exists, or it did not happen. One automatic retry
per failed bead at higher effort; a second failure escalates. File discovered work. Comment the PR
link, close the bead with what was verified, gate the landed bead with the new PR (stacked runs),
`bd dolt push`. `--suggest-next` names the next wave; claim it and go again. Epic branch: merge each
worker PR into the epic branch, serialized, at the wave boundary. Update the mirror per
`reference/mirror.md`.

Single-bead scope is the same loop with one iteration, run in one worktree.

### 7. Integrate

When the frontier is empty: restack stack bottoms onto current `main`, re-run verification, resolve
nothing silently. Epic branch: open the aggregate PR to `main`, titled as a release-worthy
conventional commit, and gate the landed bead with it — `Closes` nothing; the gate owns the epic's
close.

### 8. Report and stop

- Every bead built, with PR, branch, and what its close reason verified.
- The merge order, bottom-up per stack, and what is blocked on the user.
- Discovered work filed.
- The tracker mirror's state, the concept transition if one fired.
- The worktree list, with the cleanup offer.
- Final `bd dolt push`.

Do not merge. Do not wait for merges. The next session's `bd gate check` finishes the story.

## Other modes

- **Resume** an interrupted run — per
  [Picking up an interrupted run](#picking-up-an-interrupted-run). Reconcile, then continue the
  normal loop.
- **Abandon** a run: unclaim what is claimed and unbuilt, note why on each bead, report branches
  and PRs left standing. The user decides their fate; delete nothing.
- **Drain assistance is reporting only.** After merges, `bd gate check` and the mirror update are
  welcome; performing merges is not, and the hook enforces it.

## Rules

- **A human performs every merge to `main`; this skill performs none, in any mode.** The hook
  denying one is the system working.
- **Every `bd` write is the root's, in the primary checkout.** Workers never run `bd`; their prompt
  carries what they need and their result JSON carries what they found.
- **Closed means done — criteria verified, checks green, PR open.** Merged is the gates' to say,
  and the epic closes only when they drain.
- **Publish the claim before the work.** `bd dolt push` follows every claim and every close.
- **The graph is the sequencer.** `bd ready` decides what runs next; this skill keeps no schedule
  of its own and never starts a blocked bead.
- **Scope is exactly the bead.** Tangents become `discovered-from` beads, filed by the root, never
  fixed in passing.
- **Bead IDs ride every commit message.**
- **Depth never forces the epic branch; fan-in and don't-touch-main do**, and only when parallelism
  matters — the single topological stack is always correct.
- **Hotspot files are overlap until shown otherwise.** When parallel stacks cannot be shown safe,
  serialize.
- **Verify workers, never trust them.** Branch on the remote and PR open, or it did not happen.
- **One automatic retry, then a human.** Higher effort, fresh worker, failure reason in the prompt.
- **No permission prompts mid-run.** Workers cannot answer them; the go gate states the condition
  and offers single-task mode when it fails.
- **Tests are part of done.** Planned or discovered, written now, never deferred to `test`.
- **The local scripts are part of done.** A change that would leave a teammate's refresh stale
  changes `start` and `update` in the same PR, per `codefall-equip`.
- **Implement never writes bead metadata and never redesigns the graph.** Metadata is read as a
  recommendation; a wrong task goes back to `codefall-design`.
- **The mirror never guesses.** The spec's parent issue carries the ladder; requirement children
  close with it, not by inference.
- **`Active` is a fact, recorded once.** Only the concept's Status line, only at first claim, only
  when a concept exists.
- **Worktrees are cleaned up by offer, never by default**, and never under an open PR.
- **Never overwrite a file that has drifted.** Show the difference and ask.
