# SessionStart notice: one short notice naming what needs attention, and nothing at all when
# the project is current.
#
# It reads the shared preflight and reports. It never pulls, never runs the project's `update`,
# and never writes a file: a hook cannot ask, and a pull moves the working tree under whatever
# the session is doing (ADR-005). It always exits 0 — a session that failed to start over a
# notice would cost more than the notice is worth — and it says nothing when every line it reads
# is current, so a session that has nothing to fix opens silently.
#
# Output: plain text by default, which is what the OpenCode plugin passes to the session.
# --hook-json selects the JSON contract instead, the same shape `bd prime --hook-json` emits and
# the shape Claude Code's and Codex's SessionStart entries register this beside. Selecting a
# contract by flag is how the merge guard's --antigravity works. Antigravity has no session
# event, so nothing registers this there.
#
# The fetch is bounded rather than waited on. preflight's lines all arrive at once except the one
# the fetch precedes, so waiting a few seconds for the next line is waiting on the network and
# nothing else — `read -t` is the bound, because `timeout` and `gtimeout` are not on every machine
# and neither is a dependency worth taking for this. A run that does not finish inside the bound is
# run again with --no-fetch, which answers from the refs the checkout already has; the fetch is
# treated as failed, the same as a fetch that could not reach the remote.
#
# Usage: codefall-session-notice.sh [--hook-json] [project-dir]      (default: .)
