# Hold extensions/shared/workflow.md to docs/workflow.md.
#
# docs/workflow.md is the description of how codefall works, edited in this
# repository. extensions/shared/workflow.md is the copy `codefall init` installs
# into a project as .codefall/shared/workflow.md, which the Codefall section of
# the project's AGENTS.md points at. The copy carries its own opening, and then
# the sections a project needs, byte for byte from the source. This script
# reports where the two differ; it fails only when asked to, and rewrites the
# copy only when asked to.
#
# Usage: workflow-sync.sh [--strict] [--write]
#
#   --strict    exit 1 when a shared section differs, for CI
#   --write     replace the copy's shared sections with the source's; the copy's
#               own opening, everything before its first shared heading, is kept
#
# Shared sections, by heading, in the order the copy holds them
#   ## The chain
#   ## Keeping the project current
#   ## Who is authoritative for what
#
# A section runs from its heading to the line before the next `## ` heading or
# the end of the file, with trailing blank lines dropped. Anything in the source
# outside those sections — what init puts in place — is the CLI's business and is
# not copied.
#
# Exit codes
#   0   report printed; with --strict, every shared section is identical
#   1   --strict and at least one section differs, or --write could not write
#   2   usage error, a file missing, or a section missing from the source
