#
# The two Playwright-specific case checks. They run only when the project declares that runner in
# `test.runners` in .codefall/settings.json; otherwise the script says so and exits 0, so a CI job
# can call it unconditionally.
#
# Usage: check-cases-playwright.sh [project-dir] [--root <dir>]
#
#   project-dir   the directory holding .codefall/ (default: .)
#   --root <dir>  the testing root, overriding what settings declare
#
# Rules
#   1  every test title begins with its case id. Titles are read from
#      `npx playwright test --list --reporter=json`, i.e. from the specs as Playwright actually
#      collects them, so a title built from a template literal is checked correctly. A
#      variant-scoped title (`checkout/place-order — [saved-card] …`) satisfies the rule, since the
#      id is its prefix either way. Only specs under <root>/test-cases/ are checked; a project's
#      other Playwright tests are none of this script's business.
#   2  no `.isVisible().catch(...)` on an un-narrowed locator. `Locator.isVisible()` throws on a
#      strict-mode multi-match, so a `.catch()` around it turns "several elements matched" into
#      "no element is there" — an absence that never happened, reported as a product defect.
#      Narrowing the receiver first (`.first()`, `.last()`, `.nth(n)`) makes the read strict-safe.
#
# Rule 2 is a line-based scan rather than a parse: a receiver that spans lines is read from the
# previous non-blank line, a match after `//` on the same line is ignored, and a match inside a
# block comment or a string is still reported — quote the construct differently there.
#
# check-cases.sh holds the runner-neutral rules and does not call this script. The two are separate
# because these need a Node toolchain, which fails for reasons no case file causes.
#
# Exit codes
#   0   both rules hold, or the project does not declare playwright
#   1   at least one problem; all of them are listed
#   2   usage error, the project directory cannot be read, jq is missing, or Playwright would not
#       list its tests
