# How codefall works

codefall is a set of verbs — skills a coding harness runs on request — plus the CLI that installed
them into this project. The verbs chain from an idea to open pull requests, and every step leaves
something in the repository or in the task graph that the next step reads. Humans decide at each
gate, and a human performs every merge to `main`. This file is the map; each verb's `SKILL.md` in
the harness's skills directory holds the procedure.

This is a copy. The source is `docs/workflow.md` in the
[codefall repository](https://github.com/lividlabs/codefall-cli/blob/main/docs/workflow.md), which
is where it is edited; `codefall init` installs the copy and replaces it on a rerun.

## The chain

Each verb is explicitly invoked (`disable-model-invocation: true`), reports what it found, offers, and
applies only what the user takes. `refresh` is the one exception: it carries no such line, and an
agent may run it when the environment is stale. In order:

| Verb | Reads | Writes | Hands to |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `envision` | whatever the user arrived with: a sentence, a pitch document, a folder of mockups | `docs/visions/VISION-NNN-slug.md`, the *why*; sources kept verbatim under `docs/visions/sources/` | `scaffold` requires one; `specify` may draw on one |
| `scaffold` | a vision; an interview for what a template cannot decide | ratified ADRs, scoped `AGENTS.md` files, optionally project files, boundary lint, and the `start` and `update` scripts | a project ready for `specify` |
| `specify` | the idea or vision, and an audit of what already exists | `docs/specs/SPEC-NNN-slug.md`, the *what*: requirements with EARS acceptance criteria, mirrored to the tracker as a parent issue and one child per requirement | `design` |
| `mock-up` | a design-tool export, or nothing | `docs/mockups/<slug>/`, matching the app's own design system | `design`; an issue labelled `requires-mockup` blocks design until it exists |
| `design` | the spec, the vision, the code | `docs/designs/DESIGN-NNN-slug.md`, the *how*, scaled to the change; ADRs for hard-to-reverse choices; beads with dependency edges, each carrying its acceptance criteria and, where the task is verified through the wired product, the test case and its criteria | `implement` |
| `implement` | ready beads, an epic, or a design | a worktree per task, the test case before the code, verification against the bead's criteria and the project's checks, a pull request per task, walked in parallel waves until the frontier is empty | the human, who merges |
| `review` | anything live: uncommitted work, a branch, a PR, a path, a document | `.codefall/reviews/`, a JSON and Markdown pair per review; fixes on the target's branch for the findings the user takes | the human |
| `test` | what the project declares: suites, the changed subset, or one case in its `spec` or `agentic` modality | `.codefall/tests/`, a report per run; findings triaged, never an edit that makes a run pass | tracker issues on the user's word |

A contained fix skips the documents: `design` writes beads only when a change stays inside one
component and comes to a task or two, and `specify` is for features, not every change.

## Keeping the project current

Four verbs sit beside the chain rather than in it:

- **`equip`** builds and rebuilds what the other verbs need the project to have. One track is the
  local environment: `start` and `update`, declared under `local` in `.codefall/settings.json`
  ([ADR-005](https://github.com/lividlabs/codefall-cli/blob/main/docs/adrs/ADR-005-local-environment-scripts.md)).
  The other is the test harness: a spec runner per surface, declared in `test.runners`, its
  commands recorded in the testing root's `AGENTS.md`
  ([ADR-007](https://github.com/lividlabs/codefall-cli/blob/main/docs/adrs/ADR-007-test-cases.md)).
  One run equips one track, and setting a harness up is its own pull request.
- **`refresh`** is what to run instead of pulling by hand: fetch, fast-forward `main` when safe,
  `bd sync` the beads with their Dolt remote, run `start`, run `update` when the commit moved,
  record the commit in a git-ignored stamp. It never rebases a feature branch, stashes a dirty
  tree, or settles a conflict the sync halts on.
- **`graft`** brings a scaffolded project's documents up to the current templates, reporting each
  difference with its provenance and applying only what the user takes. It also handles first-time
  adoption of the stance on an existing repo.
- **`codefall init`** rerun (`upgrade`) reinstalls the skills and hooks for the harnesses already
  recorded, replacing its own marked sections and registrations and touching nothing else.

The scripts stay current at the point of introduction: a task that adds infrastructure, a
dependency, a migration, or generated code changes `start` or `update` in the same pull request.
`design` names it in the task, `implement` counts it toward done, and `review` carries a lens for it.

## Who is authoritative for what

- **Documents in the repository** are canonical for the why (vision), the what (spec), and the how
  (design). Each carries a `Status` that describes the document only.
- **The tracker** (GitHub Issues in this version) mirrors specs so people can see what is ready, in
  progress, and done; the spec document stays canonical.
- **Beads** is authoritative for task state from the moment a design's staged task plan is approved
  and becomes beads. A design keeps its task table — the tasks, edges, and design refs it decided,
  under the epic's ID — and never a copy of work state.
  The database on a machine is a local Dolt copy; the team's is `refs/dolt/data` on the git remote,
  and only `bd dolt pull` and `bd dolt push` move it. Every verb that writes a bead pushes after the
  write, and `refresh` syncs before work starts, so `bd ready` answers for the team and not for one
  checkout. A project with no Dolt remote is told so once and works on this machine alone.
- **A bead closes at done** — criteria verified, checks green, PR open — not at merge. Gates carry
  the merge seam: every PR gates a "landed" bead inside the epic, and the next session's `bd gate
  check` turns merges into bead state.
- **A human performs every merge to `main`.** `implement` ends at open PRs and a reported bottom-up
  merge order, and the guard hook denies the alternative in every harness.
- **Everything short of the merge is the verb's.** A verb that writes to the repository branches
  before its first file, commits what it wrote by path, and offers the push and the pull request;
  a document never sits uncommitted on `main`. `implement` does this per task; the document verbs,
  `scaffold`, `equip`, and `graft` follow the shared `landing.md` beside this file's installed copy.
- **The context that finds a problem never fixes it.** `review` runs in a subagent or another
  harness; the session triages and applies. A test criterion is never written from the
  implementation it verifies, and never edited to make a run pass.
- **A skill refuses only what it cannot do.** A missing runner, tool, or tracker profile is an exit;
  disagreement about size or fit is said aloud and then the user's call is followed.
