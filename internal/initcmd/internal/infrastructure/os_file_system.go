// Package infrastructure implements initcmd's gateways against the real process: the file system it
// writes into and the external tools codefall depends on. Both are thin adapters over
// `internal/shared/process` — what they add is initcmd's own terms, because a gateway interface
// belongs to the use case that declared it. The permissions a write uses are the shared module's
// decision, not this one's and not the use case's.
