# ADR-004: Skill Length Guidelines

## Status

Accepted — 2026-09-14

## Context

The extension ships eight skills, one `SKILL.md` each. Measured on 2026-09-14 they ran from 280 to
761 lines and from roughly 2,800 to 6,400 words, which is roughly 3,800 to 9,500 tokens depending on
the estimate. Five of the eight were over 500 lines, and six were over 5,000 tokens by at least one
estimate.

Anthropic's published guidance for Agent Skills gives two numbers for the body of a `SKILL.md`, and
the Claude Code documentation gives a third fact that makes the second one matter more than it first
appears.

**Under 500 lines.** The Agent Skills best-practices guide, the Claude Code skills page, and the
Agent Skills specification all state it the same way: keep `SKILL.md` under 500 lines and move
detailed reference material to separate files. It is the ceiling at which the guidance says to start
splitting, not a hard limit any tool enforces.

**Under 5,000 tokens.** The Agent Skills overview lists the instruction level of a skill, the body
loaded when the skill is triggered, at under 5k tokens. The specification recommends the same.

**5,000 tokens is also where Claude Code cuts.** A skill's rendered content enters the conversation
once, on invocation, and stays there across turns; Claude Code does not re-read the file. When the
conversation is compacted, Claude Code re-attaches the most recent invocation of each skill after the
summary, keeping only the first 5,000 tokens of each, within a combined budget of 25,000 tokens
across all invoked skills, most recent first. Anything past the first 5,000 tokens is dropped
silently. Every codefall skill puts its Process and Rules sections last, so those are exactly the
sections that vanish. The skills that run longest, `codefall-specify`, `codefall-design`,
`codefall-implement`, and `codefall-review`, are the ones most likely to be compacted mid-run.

Two facts about how these skills load narrow what the guidance means here. Every codefall skill sets
`disable-model-invocation: true`, so its description is not in the startup listing and costs nothing
until invoked; the listing budget and the description-truncation rules do not apply. And the docs are
explicit that the body is a recurring cost once loaded: every line competes with the conversation on
every later turn, and the authoring test is the one used for `CLAUDE.md`, whether removing the line
would cause mistakes.

The bodies grew for a reason that was itself a rule. The extension's `AGENTS.md` asked that new skill
prose be "declarative, reasons attached", and the skills complied: each carries the reasoning behind
its rules, the alternatives it rejected, and a Lineage section recording what it took from other
tools and what it deliberately dropped. None of that is instruction. The same file's own header says
the why lives in the linked docs, which is the convention every scaffolded project gets and the one
the skills stopped following for themselves. The `codefall-review` skill already keeps that material
in a `NOTES.md` beside its `SKILL.md`, described there as "none of this is instruction".

Three options were considered.

**(a) Leave the lengths alone.** The skills work. But the compaction cap is not a preference, and the
sections it removes are the ones that say what to do. A skill that loses its Rules section after
compaction is a skill that behaves differently in the second half of a long session than in the
first, with no signal that anything changed.

**(b) Hard limits, failed in CI.** Precise, and easy to enforce. It overstates what the guidance says:
the docs give ranges to stay inside, not lines to fail on, and the token figure cannot be measured
exactly without the tokenizer, which is not available offline. A hard limit on an estimate is a hard
limit on the wrong number. With eight skills, a reporting check that a person reads is enough.

**(c) Adopt the published ranges as guidelines, move what is not instruction out of `SKILL.md`, and
report against the ranges.** The numbers are the docs' numbers, not ones invented here. Reasoning
goes where the repo already says it goes. A script reports each skill against the ranges so drift is
visible, and can be made strict once every skill is inside them.

Option (c) is chosen.

## Decision

### The ranges

A `SKILL.md` body stays **under 500 lines** and **under 5,000 tokens**. Both are guidelines from the
published Agent Skills guidance, adopted as written. Neither is enforced as a hard failure by
default. The token figure is the one that matters most, because of the compaction cap; the line
figure is the earlier warning.

The token count is an estimate. Two heuristics are reported, characters divided by four and words
times 1.33, and the larger is the number to read. A skill inside the range by the larger estimate is
inside it.

### What a `SKILL.md` holds

Instruction: what the skill does, in what order, with what gate before each thing that lands. The
level of procedural detail follows the guidance's degrees of freedom. Where an operation is fragile,
where a specific sequence must be followed or a file must be edited one way, the steps stay exact.
Where several approaches are valid, the skill says what to achieve and leaves the how to the session.
The how is not what is being cut; the why is.

### What moves out, and where

- **Reasons and rejected alternatives** go to an ADR when the decision is one the repo made, or to
  the operative rules in the relevant `AGENTS.md` when it is a convention. A `SKILL.md` states the
  rule; it does not argue for it.
- **Lineage**, what a skill took from other tools and what it deliberately dropped, goes to a
  `NOTES.md` beside the `SKILL.md`, following `codefall-review`. It is a record for maintainers so
  nothing removed on purpose is re-added, and it is never loaded by the skill.
- **Reference material the skill reads on demand**, such as status lifecycle tables, landing-strategy
  detail, or lens definitions, goes to a supporting file the `SKILL.md` links directly, with a
  sentence saying what the file holds and when to read it.

### Supporting files

- Every supporting file is linked **directly from `SKILL.md`**, one level deep. A supporting file
  does not link on to a further file the `SKILL.md` does not also link, because Claude may preview
  rather than read a file reached through another file.
- A supporting file **over 100 lines** opens with a table of contents, so a partial read still shows
  what the file contains.
- Directories are named for what they hold. Existing names stay: `templates/` for what a skill
  installs, `trackers/` for tracker profiles, `scripts/` for what a skill runs. Material a skill reads
  on demand goes under `reference/`. The names are the guidance's examples, not a fixed set; a skill
  adds a directory when it has a kind of content the existing names do not describe.
- Paths inside a skill stay relative to the skill's own directory, as the extension's rules already
  require.

### Measurement

A script in the extension reports every skill against the ranges and the supporting-file rules
above: lines, words, both token estimates, description length against the 1,024-character maximum,
the frontmatter name matching the directory, every link resolving one level deep, and a table of
contents in any supporting file over 100 lines. It reports by default. A strict flag makes it exit
non-zero on any skill outside the ranges, for CI once every skill is inside them.

## Consequences

- **The Rules section survives compaction.** A skill inside the token range is re-attached whole after
  a compaction, so the second half of a long session runs under the same instructions as the first.
- **Reasoning has one home per kind, and it is not the skill.** A reader who wants to know why a skill
  does something reads an ADR, an `AGENTS.md`, or a `NOTES.md`, the same places a scaffolded project
  sends its own readers. A skill that restates its reasons is drifting and the script will show it.
- **The register changes.** The extension's rules asked for reasons attached; they now ask for
  instruction alone, with the reasons linked. Existing prose that reads as argument is rewritten as
  rule when its skill is shortened, and new prose is written that way from the start.
- **Estimates, not counts.** The token figures are heuristics because the tokenizer is not available
  to a script. Two estimates with the larger read as the number keeps the error on the safe side;
  a skill that is close by the larger estimate is close.
- **More files per skill.** Progressive disclosure trades one long file for a short file and several
  linked ones. The linking rules, one level deep and a table of contents past 100 lines, are what
  keep that from becoming a maze; the script checks both.
- **A guideline can be ignored.** Nothing fails until the strict flag is on in CI. That is accepted
  on purpose: eight skills, one report, and a person reading it is enough, and the flag is there for
  the day it is not.
